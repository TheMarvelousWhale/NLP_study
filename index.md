## Welcome to Sosig Catto's NLP Page 

_Yes it is the same Sosig Catto (pronounced: '[sɒsɪʤz](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=sausage+ipa+pronunciation)') that provides the answers for the NTU4069 Malware Analysis Cohort_

This page is where I maintain a comprehensive, single-endpoint for all of my NLP journey. It acts as a journal, literature review, updates keeping, a code practice playground, previous work done aat A*STAR as well as host my FYP ( because I want to yeet everything in one place).
