# Machine Learning study notes

Prerequisites: 

[Linear Algebra]( http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html):pProbably cannot do the decomposition by hand yet but the concepts are well understood. 

[Probability]( http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html ): Many concepts learnt in different courses in NTU.

[Numerical Computation](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/numerical.html ): Have seen each concept before, never had the chance to practice. 



[Machine Learning Basics](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html ) (66 pages)  

[Deep FeedForward Net](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/mlp.html) (60 pages)
